# OpenTable (placeholder)

## Concept
This app is designed to support traditional board game play in an online setting with multiple players jumping in and out of games. It will be something like a Roll20 clone. It will have multiple die-rolling functions through Python, profile pages for players and game organizers, options for uploading rules to the site, wish lists for players looking for groups and organizers looking for players. A chatroom-style interface accessible to players and organizers will be the means through which actual games are played. If there is time, I will add a game/player search function.

### Functions
* Die rolling system
* Personalized profile pages
  - Bio
  - Blog
  - Playgroup Records
  - Game Wish List
* Game/Die/Record keeping customizability (Ties into Playgroup Records)
* Scheduling system (Ties into Bio)
* Forum-style playgroup page.
